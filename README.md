# Simple-Chat-Application
Simple Chat Application made in C++ in 12th grade using C++ graphics among computers in a network using the shared space. 


 INTRODUCTION

Dev-C++ is a free full-featured integrated development environment (IDE) distributed under the GNU General Public License for programming in C and C++. It is written in Delphi.
It is bundled with, and uses, the MinGW or TDM-GCC 64 bit port of the GCC as its compiler. Dev-C++ can also be used in combination with Cygwin or any other GCC-based compiler.

Bloodshed Dev-C++ is a full-featured Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the C/C++programming language. It uses Mingw port of GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) as it's compiler.

This project has been made entirely using Dev C++ with the header file graphics.h.

GRAPHICS.H: An interface which provides access to a simple graphics
Library that makes it possible to draw  lines, rectangles, ovals, arcs, polygons, images and strings on a graphical window.

PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

AIM:  To facilitate communication between parties, especially within connected school lab systems without the usage of the internet. 

Target audience: This application can be used by people of all ages to stay connected. As this works without the internet, it can be used in offices with connected workstations to maintain contact via messages even in the absence of the internet. 

Need for the project: 

Maintenance of communication without usage of internet via messages in connected workstations.

Caters to the ever growing demands to be constantly connected in this fast-paced world where technology is able to achieve such constant communication channels for important message transfers

Can also be upscaled to have more utilities for sharing emoji, etc.
